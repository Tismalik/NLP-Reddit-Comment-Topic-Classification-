Would you still allow it?\\n\\nAs long as these individuals are not directly advocating direct violence themselves, yes.  The guilt lies with people who turn their hate to violence.  Someone who hears extreme ideas and turns them into evil acts is responsible for that alone.  To say otherwise is to deny the agency and responsibility each of us has for our own actions.\\n\\n&gt;Oh you're one of those people. Someone who doubts the effectivity of all modern western societies, just because we are not all of the same colour and do not all have the same traditions.\\n\\nQuite the opposite.  The paradox you present doubts it, because it assumes some external force (suppression of freedoms) is needed to hold different people together.  I believe that people, when in a society that promotes liberty and prosperity, will naturally move away from hate and towards cooperation even without hate speech laws.It takes time, there will be setbacks, as the wounds of history are deep, but largely we march ever forward if you look at the arc of history.

That’s absurd. And you know, there’s no basis to it.”\\n\\n&gt; July 24, 2016: Donald Trump Jr. appeared on CNN and told Jake Tapper that the Clinton campaign’s suggestion that Russia was helping Trump was “disgusting” and “phony,” noting, “Well, it just goes to show you their exact moral compass. I mean, they will say anything to be able to win this. I mean, this is time and time again, lie after lie.”\\n\\n&gt;&gt; (July 16, 2018: The Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asked, “President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?” But how exactly did Vladimir Putin respond to those pointed questions? If you listen to the English translation that was broadcast during the press conference, the Russian leader said, [“Yes, I did. Yes, I did.\"](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/565481/))\\n\\n&gt; July 27, 2016:\\xa0Trump appeared on a CBS Miami news station and, in response to allegations that Russia was trying to help him win the election, told Jim DeFed, “I can tell you I think if I came up with that they’d say, ‘Oh, it’s a conspiracy theory, it’s ridiculous’ … I mean I have nothing to do with Russia. I don’t have any jobs in Russia. I’m all over the world but we’re not involved in Russia.”\\n\\n&gt; October 24, 2016:\\xa0At a rally in Tampa, Florida, Trump stated he has “nothing to do with Russia, folks. I’ll give you a written statement.”\\n\\n&gt; November 11, 2016:\\xa0Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks gave the Associated Press a blanket denial of Trump campaign contacts with Russia, stating, “It never happened. There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.”\\n\\n&gt; December 18, 2016:\\xa0Kellyanne Conway went on “Face the Nation,” and John Dickerson asked her, “Did anyone involved … in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election?” Conway responded, “Absolutely not. And I discussed that with the president-elect just last night. Those conversations never happened. I hear people saying it like it’s a fact on television. That is just not only inaccurate and false, but it’s dangerous.”\\n\\n&gt; January 10, 2017:\\xa0At a hearing for Jeff Sessions’ nomination for the position of attorney general, Senator Al Franken asked him what he would do if there was evidence “that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign.” Sessions replied, “I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.”\\n\\n&gt; January 15, 2017:\\xa0Vice President-elect Mike Pence went on “Fox News Sunday,”and Chris Wallace asked him, “So, I’m asking a direct question: was there any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin or cutouts they had?” Pence replied, “Of course not. Why would there be any contacts between the campaign?\\n\\n&gt; \\xa0January 15, 2017:\\xa0That same day, Pence also went on “Face the Nation,” where John Dickerson asked him, “Just to button up one question, did any advisor or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?” Pence replied, “Of course not. And I think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.”\\n\\n&gt; February 16, 2017:\\xa0Trump held a press conference and told reporters, “Russia is a ruse. I know you have to get up and ask a question. It’s so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.”\\n\\n&gt; \\xa0February 19, 2017:\\xa0White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus went on “Fox News Sunday,” and when Chris Wallace asked whether the Trump team had any connections to Russia, Preibus said “no.” Preibus later went on to add, “Let me give you an example. First of all, The New York Times put out an article with no direct sources that said that the Trump campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies, basically, you know, some treasonous type of accusations. We have now all kinds of people looking into this. I can assure you and I have been approved to say this—that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that that story is not only inaccurate, but it’s grossly overstated and it was wrong. And there’s nothing to it.”\\n\\n&gt; February 20, 2017:\\xa0White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, stating, “This is a nonstory because to the best of our knowledge, no contacts took place, so it’s hard to make a comment on something that never happened.”\\n\\n&gt; February 24, 2017:\\xa0At a White House press briefing, Sean Spicer was asked whether “the President has an improper relationship with Russia” and responded, “He has no interests in Russia. He has no—there’s only so many times he can deny something that doesn’t exist.”\\n\\n&gt; May 11, 2017:\\xa0In an interview with NBC, Trump told Lester Holt, “I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago. I had the Miss Universe pageant—which I owned for quite a while—I had it in Moscow a long time ago. But other than that I have nothing to do with Russia.” Later in the interview, when discussing Comey’s firing, Trump stated, “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself—I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election they should’ve won.”\\n\\n&gt; May 18, 2017:\\xa0At a press conference in May 2017, Trump repeatedly denied any collusion occurred between his campaign and Russia, at one point stating, “[T] he entire thing has been a witch hunt.

       " {'body': 'If you buy a bond, let’s say a treasury with a 2.4% interest rate, and rates go up so now there are new treasuries which are otherwise identical except for the fact that they pay a 2.8% interest rate instead of 2.4%, yes the value of your 2.4% bonds goes down. Why would anybody buy your 2.4% bonds for the same price you paid and make 2.4% if they can buy new bonds that are basically identical but pay 2.8%? \\n\\nThe price people are willing to pay for your 2.4% bonds should adjust downward so the effective rate of return is the same as the identical 2.8% bonds.\\n\\nThis is how a bond works - there is a current face amount, a coupon, and a yield. The current face amount is the amount of principal the borrower must repay, and is quoted in dollars. The coupon is what % of the current face amount has to be paid in interest on each payment date, and is quoted as a %. So a $100 face amount treasury with a 5% coupon will pay the lender $100*5%=$5 on each payment date plus $100 of principal on the maturity date. The yield is the rate of return to the lender on buying the bond, and is effectively how much dollars did I put out vs how much dollars did I get back adjusted for the time period I held the position for. Importantly, with yield it doesn’t matter whether those dollars you get back are principal dollars or interest dollars, a dollar is a dollar. When you buy a bond for the face amount, the yield and coupon are equal to each other.\\n\\nSo going with your 2.4/2.8 scenario and assuming assuming $100 face amount and that there is only one payment date which is also the maturity date one year from the date you buy the bond to make the math easy, this is how it would work:\\n\\nThe 2.4% bond would pay an investor $102.4 on the payment/maturity date (2.4 of interest because the 2.4% coupon * $100 face = 2.4, and $100 of face amount), while the 2.8% bond would pay the investor $102.8 (same math but swap 2.8 for 2.4). Since the bonds are otherwise identical, you would not want to pay the same price for the promise to receive 102.4 as 102.8, you would adjust the price you would pay for the 102.4 promise down until the yield, the rate of return on investment is the same. Assuming you are willing to pay 100 for the 102.8 bond, the amount you should pay for the 102.4 bond is ~$99.6, since 102.4/99.6 is about the same as 102.8/100, so you get pretty much the same cash back for every dollar you invest.\\n\\nThat is why rates up means bond prices down - equivalent investments should earn equivalent returns.',\n",

The operation is the latest effort by Brazilian authorities to clamp down on collusion and price fixing in the fuel distribution market, which has been the most common target of accusations for cartel behavior by antitrust watchdog Cade.\\n\\n\\n*****\\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/93jvvg/brazils_three_largest_fuel_distribution_companies/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~339891 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM\\'s and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **price**^#1 **fuel**^#2 **company**^#3 **station**^#4 **distribution**^#5',\n",

It was also my first contribution to Reddit, so a conscious decision to do what represents me was made -  if that helps. \\n   Pared down I could have said after 45 years of being involved in the drug world and rock bands, I\\'ve come to see that this discussion leads to virtually nowhere. We are in more trouble from lacking commonality of  language and understanding word definitions, both properly used and the meaning of ; when said under false definition.  So in my opinion , until we make effort toward that problem , these types of opinions, facts ( cold and sterile) staid or vitriolically stated will probably get us nowhere , My strong belief in that \" truth\" drove my decision  to make it human, heartfelt and sad, tragic and funny, full of hope and hopeless in a novel where those non-members of the choir, might find a cathartic light at the end of that tunnel vision world they move through and see someone they know personally in a character of my novel . Believe me, I know, have known, did know and miss every one of the ostensively fictional characters ive introduced to the readers, should there ever be any. \\n    I get it though and do not dispute your opinion. I should have stuck to the more direct, opinion driven, for or against posting along with the rest with or without those cold sterile facts or graphs.. \\n   I thought about that, but I\\'m sure I would not have added anything that wasn\\'t already covered, so I did what was me and hoped it might stand apart (in any manner. ) So to say I said a lot without saying anything in my post was exactly what my first words were saying, just as they\\'ve been doing for over 35 years now. \\n   Thanks for adding to my education and understanding.
