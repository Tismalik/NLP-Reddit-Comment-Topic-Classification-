The house of Hannover are direct descendants of James I, though through a daughter after the mess of the second English Civil War. Are they German? Sure I guess, though so were the Angles and the Saxons and they're bloodline descendants of original kings of Wessex too.

This shit is pretty complicated. For example King George V, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and the Tsarina of Russia were first cousins. World War 1 is fought between relatives.

&gt; The daughter of top Nazi Heinrich Himmler was hired by West Germany&amp;#039;s foreign intelligence agency in the 1960s, officials have confirmed.

&gt; The head of the spy agency&amp;#039;s history department then corroborated the newspaper report about Burwitz&amp;#039;s activities in West Germany, which reunited with communist East Germany in 1990 to form the present German state.

&gt; German organisations such as the BND have grappled with how to address their own Nazi links in the post-war era.

&gt; At the height of election season in Mexico, contraband means mostly political campaign ads: Guards confiscated thousands of banners and posters, from every major political party in Mexico, in just a few weeks.

&gt; These ads, along with the political parties that produce them, are completely banned in Cher&amp;aacute;n, and have been since 2011, when residents overthrew their local government and started over.

&gt; For many in Mexico, especially in an election year marred by wanton political murders, Cher&amp;aacute;n stands as proof that, in the country&amp;#039;s entrenched cycle of violence, the key ingredient is the state.

&gt; A court in Ecuador has ruled that the nation&amp;#039;s ban on same-sex marriage is illegal.

&gt; Family, Women, Children and Adolescents Court Judges Iliana Vallejo and Ruth Alvarez both ruled that rejection of the women&amp;#039;s marriage license applications was a violation of their human rights.

If you need such an hysterical analogy to get your point across, then you clearly do not have enough of an argument to justify your outrageous claims.

&gt; Uribe has remained a polarizing kingmaker in Colombian politics as his party has sought to stymie a peace accord with Marxist rebels.

"That's not what I'm saying, I'm not holding some drugs to a different standard. I am simply saying that it's not a ""victimless crime"" in many cases and I'd make the same case for someone that commits a crime while drunk. Drinking isn't a victimless crime as alcohol is not illegal; however, even drinking when it is illegal i.e underage, even then it's not victimless as in many cases the underage drinkers will cause an accident of some sort which can result in injury or death.

All in all, I'm for legalizing all drugs and taxing them like alcohol, as well as having better rehabilitation facilities. The only time I would consider arresting drug users at that point would be if they committed a crime or drove while high, just like alcohol",1,federal government says it will not consider

&gt; The ruling party in South Africa, African National Congress, will submit a proposal to amend the country&amp;#039;s constitution to help push through its land reform, the country&amp;#039;s President Cyril Ramaphosa told the nation on Tuesday.

&gt; Almost one-third of the arable land on South Africa is privately owned, and white farmers own 72 percent of it, compared to only 4 percent from the majority black population.

&gt; During his Thursday address, Ramaphosa said the reform would &amp;quot;Unlock economic growth by bringing more land in South Africa to full use&amp;quot; and let millions more contribute to the nation&amp;#039;s economy.

&gt; An alleged neo-Nazi was acquitted by a German court Tuesday for a bombing 18 years ago targeting Jewish immigrants, in what angry victims&amp;#039; advocates called a historic &amp;quot;Legal mistake&amp;quot;.

&gt; Duesseldorf police had questioned Spies and placed him under surveillance soon after the bombing before determining they did not have enough evidence to arrest him.

&gt; The government has outlined plans to implement a new system of consent for organ and tissue donation in order to tackle a shortage of donors.

&gt; There will be a 12-month transition period to allow time for discussion with friends and family about organ donation preferences.

&gt; While the new system shifts the balance of presumption in favour of organ donation, those who do not wish to donate their organs will still be able to record their decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register, either via NHS Blood and Transplant&amp;#039;s website or by calling their helpline.

&gt; Britain would run out of food on this date next year if it cannot continue to easily import from the EU and elsewhere after Brexit, the National Farmers&amp;#039; Union has warned.

&gt; Research showed 7 August 2019 would be the nominal day that Britain would run out of food if it were asked to be wholly self-sufficient based on seasonal growth, the NFU said.

"I'm not disagreeing with you here, because my experience is likely in the minority.

Grew up in a rural area, US, most people were farmers or had to commute to a small City for work. Not a ton of college degrees if you get what I'm saying.

Anyways, I went to a rural school and you know what I saw...kids with $60,000 trucks and a ""fuck you"" attitude to those who wanted to go to college. The stigma in rural schools that I saw mostly was that women would go to some form of higher education and guys would get ""hard working"" jobs or would go to trade school for 2 years. Trade school offered skilled ""hard working"" jobs like welding that required a slip of paper to show you were competent.

Again, just an anecdote, but when people scream about how we are hurting the opportunities for ""them poor farmers"", I can't help but feel no remorse as the people I knew from primary school were mostly what I'd call rednecks.

&gt; France plans to introduce a penalty system next year that would increase the costs of consumer goods with packaging made of non-recycled plastic, part of a pledge to use only recycled plastic nationwide by 2025, an environment ministry official said Sunday.

&gt; Under the new plan, products with recycled plastic packaging could cost up to 10 percent less, Poirson said.

&gt; &amp;quot;For bottles, giving consumers a choice is possible. But we can&amp;#039;t forget other items - today there&amp;#039;s no recycled plastic available for yogurt pots,&amp;quot; he said.

If all proposed tariffs go into effect, and no resolution is found in the next 6 months, expect annual GDP to be below 3%. If MORE tariffs are imposed, and more are proposed, expect as low as 2%, possibly heading towards a recession.

2) It signals to me that it is not a place where kids will be welcome by patrons of staff, which is fine.

&gt; I applaud the Trump administration for highlighting China&amp;#039;s economic aggression and the need to respond.

The problem is when channels such as CNN hide behind the facade of ""free press"", when in reality theyre just as partisan as fox. 

Edit: A good example of this is r/The_Donald and r/politics. The former is outright with their support of our president, and any newcomer to that sub knows what to expect.

&gt; China is to slap tariffs on an additional $60bn of imports from the US in retaliation against $200bn of new trade sanctions on Chinese goods announced by Donald Trump.

&gt; &amp;quot;The US president added:&amp;quot;What China does not understand is that these people are great patriots and fully understand that China has been taking advantage of the United States on trade for many years.

&gt; China faces difficulty in responding on a scale equal to Trump&amp;#039;s new tariffs because its annual imports from the US total only about $130bn, while its exports to the US total more than $500bn.

&gt; A senior Hamas official on Sunday accused Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas of fomenting violence in the region and pushing Israel toward a new war in the Gaza Strip.

&gt; Kahlil al-Hayya, a senior member of the Hamas political bureau, told Gaza newspaper Felesteen that the ruling terrorist group would respond with a &amp;quot;Free hand&amp;quot; against any additional measures imposed by the rival Ramallah government headed by Abbas.

&gt; Abbas has slashed funding to Gaza and cut salaries of PA employees there to pressure Hamas into handing over the territory, making it increasingly difficult for Hamas to govern.

&gt; Beirut - A formerly US-backed Syrian rebel group on Saturday rejected a deal between Russia and Turkey to avert a large-scale military assault on rebel-held Idlib province.

&gt; The deal makes way for a demilitarised zone between rebel and regime-held areas in and around the northwestern governorate, Syria&amp;#039;s last insurgent bastion.

&gt; Pro-Turkey rebels have cautiously accepted the deal, but the Jaysh al-Izza faction on Saturday rejected it, saying the zone to be set up by October 15 would only encompass territory currently under rebel control.

What happens when sexuality is suppressed completely from the very moment that you first start experiencing those feelings?
This is just my opinion, but I find it very coincidental that so many victims of clerical abuse are males around the age at which the abusers themselves entered the seminary. Having your own sexuality suppressed like that from such a crucial age must cause all kinds of warped thinking and issues.

&gt; A Saudi airstrike has claimed the lives of at least 20 Yemeni civilians and 10 others sustained injuries in province of Hudaydah as the regime in Riyadh continues its atrocious campaign against its crisis-hit southern neighbor.

&gt; According to Yemen&amp;#039;s al-Masirah television network, the casualties were caused after Saudi warplanes targeted a group of farmers in a vegetables market in Masoudi area of Bayt al-Faqih district of the western province on Wednesday.

&gt; On October 13, the Saudi planes targeted two buses that were carrying civilians fleeing the port city of Hudaydah, killing at least 17 civilians and wounding 20 others.
