&gt; A powerful earthquake struck eastern Turkey on Friday, killing four people and damaging buildings near the epicentre of the tremor, which was also felt in neighbouring countries.

&gt; More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck the western city of Izmit, 90 km southeast of Istanbul.

&gt; In 2011 an earthquake struck the eastern city of Van and the town of Ercis, some 100 km to the north, killing at least 523 people.

&gt; WUHAN: China reported 15 more deaths and 180 new cases of coronavirus, according to a statement from the health department of Hubei province on Saturday, as the outbreak escalates.

&gt; The outbreak that began in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, has prompted China to ramp up measures to contain the virus including suspending public transport in 10 cities, shutting temples over the Chinese New Year holiday and closing part of the Great Wall.

&gt; China on Friday imposed transport bans in an area covering a staggering 41 million people, as the United States confirmed its second case of the SARS-like virus that has reached almost a dozen countries.

Reducing exposure time and maximizing distance works for any type of activity, whether alpha, beta, gamma, or neutron. Shielding needs to be tailored to the activity and is generally a last resort for discrete, highly active sources.

When the money was frozen it put a delay on the process of assignment. Then, before trump claimed to release it, the state dept released the money because it claimed that trump didn’t have the authority to place the hold and it did so on a specific date because it takes 30 days for congress to approve where it was assigned and if it wasn’t approved before the end of the fiscal deadline then the money would go back into the general budget (and because it wasn’t spent, it wouldn’t be appropriated again the next year).

So, something like 80% of the 400 million was able to be released in time to be assigned andapproved and then congress took up a bill to allow the rest to be placed and not have it reabsorbed away from the state dept.

Antibiotics work in every species because they target the parts of bacteria that are (mostly) the same in all species. Those are not at all related to the infection mechanism that allows it to cause a disease. So just because we can use the same substances to kill bacteria in fish and in human doesn't mean that there is an increased risk. Especially since in this case it's about viruses and those aren't even affected by antibiotics. A disease jumping from fish to human is extremely unlikely and as far as i know unprecedented.

Meanwhile the full-on Remain heartlands like London largely don't vote Tory anyway. 

Meanwhile, most of the marginals are Leave-voting constituencies, and Boris will be helped there by Labour's colossal weakness and Lib Dems splitting the remain vote. His fear will be that the Brexit Party might do the same to him, however.

One of the big things is to compare how things went in 2017, when May ran an absolute shocker of a campaign, ineffectually trying to focus on Brexit at a time the electorate wasn't interested and Corbyn was a lot more popular than he is now. A ton has changed since then.",1,mps back 12 december election

&gt; Which Middle East and North Africa nations could decarbonize industrial heat with CSH most cost-effectively?

&gt; Cuadros presented very detailed calculations showing where CSH could be substituted at a lower cost than fossil fuels within each MENA region country, by comparing CSH costs to the fossil fuel costs currently used locally for heat in these industries.

&gt; With HPAs, utility-scale solar heat producers could set up large CSH utilities, and sell heat to multiple smaller firms clustered in industrial parks.

&gt; ISTANBUL - The head of Turkey&amp;#039;s main opposition party in Istanbul was sentenced to nearly 10 years on Friday on a range of charges including &amp;quot;Terrorist propaganda&amp;quot; and insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

&gt; Kaftancioglu, a doctor by profession, played a key role in the shock victory of the CHP&amp;#039;s new Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu earlier this year - the first time Erdogan&amp;#039;s party had lost power in Turkey&amp;#039;s biggest city for 25 years.

&gt; BANGKOK: The US and 10 Southeast Asian states will hold their first-ever joint maritime exercises in September, aimed at preventing &amp;quot;Wrongdoing&amp;quot; as Washington and Beijing jostle for influence in the region.

&gt; Despite having conflicting interests with four rival claimants in ASEAN, China last year held a joint maritime drill with the regional bloc.

&gt; A new study provides the most accurate estimate of the frequency that planets that are similar to Earth in size and in distance from their host star occur around stars similar to our Sun.

&gt; Knowing the rate that these potentially habitable planets occur will be important for designing future astronomical missions to characterize nearby rocky planets around sun-like stars that could support life.

&gt; One method is claiming that YouTubers are actually employees of YouTube and not self-employed like the company claims.

&gt; &amp;quot;There is some evidence that YouTubers may be falsely self-employed. For example, they are continuously rated and monitored by YouTube, and only YouTube managers the relationship with advertisers,&amp;quot; said IG Metall lawyer Thomas Klebe in a video announcing the partnership.

&gt; If the U.S. continues to raise a wall of tariffs on Chinese goods in the coming months and China responds, expect a global recession in three quarters, Morgan Stanley said Monday.

&gt; &amp;quot;As we view the risk of further escalation as high, the risks to the global outlook are decidedly skewed to the downside,&amp;quot; Morgan Stanley chief economist Chetan Ahya said.

&gt; The firm believes a global recession will come in about nine months if the trade war further escalates through the U.S. raising tariffs to 25% &amp;quot;On all imports from China for 4-6 months,&amp;quot; Ahya said.

&gt; Scientists have discovered the first ever species of bioluminescent click beetle in Asia which remarkably appears to have evolved there for the first time.

&gt; Scientists affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Science in Kunming alongside others published their paper describing the new species in the journal ZooKeys.

&gt; The paper&amp;#039;s co-author Dr Xue-Yan Li explained that the beetle was not only a completely new species of click beetle, but an entirely new genus and subfamily.

&gt; Nissan Motor Co. plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs globally as part of efforts to turn around its business, company sources said Tuesday.

&gt; Since the arrest in November of its former Chairman Carlos Ghosn over alleged financial misdeeds, Nissan has been struggling to restructure its management team and ties with Renault SA, its biggest shareholder.

&gt; In fiscal 2018, Nissan saw its global vehicle sales fall 4.4 percent to 5.52 million units, including a 9.3 percent decline in the United States to 1.44 million units and a 14.9 percent drop in Europe to 643,000 units.

I can only imagine that many innocent felons giving up on fighting for their innocence because the system is quite broken.

Highly recommend watching it, it is so well done and they worked closely with the exonerated five to tell their story. If anyone watches it, definitely watch the interview with Oprah after.

&gt; Mexico City - Mexico has deployed nearly 15,000 soldiers and National Guardsmen to its border with the United States, the army chief said Monday - admitting they are detaining migrants who try to cross, after the policy triggered backlash.

&gt; Under pressure from US President Donald Trump to slow the surge of Central Americans crossing the border, Mexico promised earlier this month to reinforce its southern border with 6,000 National Guardsmen, but had not previously disclosed the extent of the crackdown on its northern border.

&gt; The Mexican security forces had not typically detained migrants at the US border in the past.

&gt; Israel&amp;#039;s Mossad spy agency was responsible for providing British authorities with information that helped foil Hezbollah&amp;#039;s efforts to stockpile explosives in London in 2015, a senior Israeli official told the Kan public broadcaster Monday.

&gt; The report said the raid came just months after the UK joined the US and other world powers in signing the Iran nuclear deal, and speculated that it was hushed up to avoid derailing the agreement with Tehran, which is the main patron of Hezbollah.

&gt; It said UK intelligence used the opportunity to try and establish what Hezbollah was up to, and so did not disrupt it immediately.

&gt; Police and anti-extradition law protesters continued a tense standoff into the night on Wednesday after a day of grisly clashes left 72 injured.

&gt; The protesters&amp;#039; road occupation around government headquarters ended in violence after the police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets as demonstrators lurched forward throwing umbrellas and bricks.

&gt; Man-kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, also decried the use of force against protesters: &amp;quot;The ugly scenes of police using tear gas and pepper spray against overwhelmingly peaceful protesters is a violation of international law,&amp;quot; he said.

Now to understand further implications of how that applies to criminal charges ultimately bring brought requires an understanding of nuance and a willingness to engage in good faith arguments, of which I'm certain you and like minded folk are incapable, based on your propagandized talking point of a comment.

Sure Sanders starting late was a factor in the outcome. As we're dozens of other factors. But DNC corruption was also a factor.

Worse however the DNC corruption caused people who would have voted for HRC to stay home, to vote third party, and in some cases vote for Trump. So the effects of DNC corruption went way beyond what anyone expected and resulted in President Trump.

&gt; WASHINGTON- Glaciers are set to disappear completely from almost half of World Heritage sites if business-as-usual emissions continue, according to the first-ever global study of World Heritage glaciers.

&gt; The authors predict glacier extinction by 2100 under a high emission scenario in 21 of the 46 natural World Heritage sites where glaciers are currently found.

&gt; The authors of the study also developed the first ever inventory of glaciers on the UNESCO World Heritage list, documenting about 19,000 glaciers present in 46 out of the 247 natural World Heritage sites.

&gt; One hundred ritually sacrificed guinea pigs dressed up in jewellery have been discovered at an Inca archaeological site in Peru.

&gt; &amp;quot;A good number of the guinea pigs were found in an excellent state of preservation-naturally mummified. These animals were also found with their heads up. The well-preserved guinea pigs do not exhibit any sign of trauma or cuts, suggesting again that they may have been alive when buried.""

&gt; On Wednesday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that in September 2016, a man went to police in the Melbourne suburb of Eltham after receiving a death threat from Tarrant via Facebook.

&gt; The man made a screenshot of Tarrant&amp;#039;s Facebook message and took it to police, who dismissed the death threat and told him to block Tarrant on Facebook.

&gt; There is no innocent explanation for police refusing to investigate or even, apparently, make a record of Tarrant&amp;#039;s death threat.

"Just want to clarify that “the ultra Orthodox Jews” you are referring to are actually a very small fringe group of Chasidic Jews based in New York and their opinion on Israel certainly does not reflect the majority opinion amongst equally ultra Orthodox Jews. In fact, this fringe group is largely resented or ignored amongst most other Jewish communities. It’s much more accurate to say that most Jews, regardless of level of observance, do support Israel. This includes the majority of Chassidic and other “ultra Orthodox Jews.” 

I would also say that there are many nonreligious  Jews that have a more moderate stance that sympathizes with both Palestine and Israel, and even some who are against the current stance of Israel. But then again I question why we still call nonreligious Jews “Jews” at all. Is a Jew who isn’t Jewish still a Jew?",1,all 28 states of the european union unanimously

&gt; WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be very disappointed in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if reports about rebuilding at a rocket launch site in North Korea were true.

&gt; &amp;quot;I would be very disappointed if that were happening,&amp;quot; Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, when asked if North Korea was breaking a promise.

&gt; While North Korea&amp;#039;s official media said last week that Kim and Trump had decided at the summit to continue talks, its vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, told reporters Kim &amp;quot;Might lose his willingness to pursue a deal&amp;quot; and questioned the need to continue.

"""Such programs remain widely praised today, even given their failures. They are features of every ""capitalist"" democracy. Keynes himself admired the Nazi economic program, writing in the foreword to the German edition to the General Theory: ""[T]he theory of output as a whole, which is what the following book purports to provide, is much more easily adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state, than is the theory of production and distribution of a given output produced under the conditions of free competition and a large measure of laissez-faire.""
Keynes's comment, which may shock many, did not come out of the blue. Hitler's economists rejected laissez-faire, and admired Keynes, even foreshadowing him in many ways. Similarly, the Keynesians admired Hitler (see George Garvy, ""Keynes and the Economic Activists of Pre-Hitler Germany,"" The Journal of Political Economy, Volume 83, Issue 2, April 1975, pp. 391–405).""

&gt; According to the report, the Saudi king&amp;#039;s special envoy, Bandar bin Sultan, and another top official met with Netanyahu in an unnamed third country, and proposed the two countries jointly announce the peace initiative at the UN general assembly later that month.

I remember you only need around 150 individuals (in a truly random sample) to extrapolate to the rest of the population, no matter the size of the population. What is actually a more important factor of how many individuals you need is effect size, and whether the sample is actually random.

Effect size measures how correlated the two variables are. Most of the time it's not even worth publishing a paper on effect sizes smaller than .2, because it means the effect you're measuring isn't correlated. Either way, this is only measuring correlation and not causation.

50 individuals is on the lower side unless they assume there is a larger effect size or they don't need a large power (confidence of findings). So they might be basing the sample size off previous tests, which lowers the bar for power, or they expect the effect size to be quite large.

"Absolutely not true. Ever hear of the millions that died from the 1918 Spanish Flu? Many were in top health and young. In fact their strong immune systems are part of the reason why they died.
It is called cytokine storm. 

&gt;A cytokine storm is an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds (cytokines), which, in a flu infection, is often associated with a surge of activated immune cells into the lungs.



&gt;Cytokine storm is now seen as a likely major cause of mortality in the 1918-20 “Spanish flu”—which killed more than 50 million people worldwide—and the H1N1 “swine flu” and H5N1 “bird flu” of recent years. ... “That was really the first demonstration that inhibiting the cytokine storm is protective,”  

Flu vaccines can also be cross-protective to some extent so even if the strain in the vaccine is not the exact one it can still help.

Psychologists try to figure out where the main issue lies. Sometimes it really is so bad that there's very little that can be done.

The reason why I suggest a psychologist is because it is a mental disorder.

&gt; In a newspaper interview on Thursday, Jean Wyllys said he was currently outside of Brazil and had no plans to return after a growing number of threats over the past year.

&gt; In Congress, Wyllys was frequently at odds with Bolsonaro, a congressman for 28 years with a long history of homophobic, racist and sexist comments.

"" On mobile right now so can't be arsed to provide you with who coined the term but obviously it makes sense. In theory someone with absolute power who only cares about the well being of his people would obviously be an ideal form of government. Lots of people will spout this without really thinking about it. In reality even if you had a benevolent dictator other people would be trying to usurp his power. This would range from advisors trying to advance their own agendas to full blown coups trying to gain power. Now the king/dictator would have to compromise his values in order to stay in power.

Khashoggi was also technically on Saudi Soil when the murder occured so there is some deniability there. Also the US's orange leader didn't press for major repercussions because... Well just follow the money. 

Canada has no Saudi embassy at the moment so any incursion through covert means can't be written off as anything other than a foreign government acting in a hostile manner within our boarders. While I doubt it would turn into war I'm sure it would ratchet up tensions very rapidly between our nation's. Canada may respond diplomatically very harshly or may respond through equally covert means.

&gt; AFP Violence has flared between Israel and Gaza, a day after seven militants and an Israeli soldier were killed amid an undercover Israeli operation in Gaza.

&gt; According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli unit was about 3km inside the Gaza Strip, which borders Israel, when militants from Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, stopped the car.

&gt; More than 200 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of March - most during weekly protests along the border at which thousands have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel.

&gt; The clashes killed an Israeli lieutenant colonel and prompted Israeli airstrikes and a salvo of rocket fire from Gaza toward Israel.

&gt; More than 170 demonstrators, most unarmed, have been killed by Israeli army fire in the confrontations, in which some of the participants threw stones, burned tires or hurled grenades toward Israeli forces.

President Barack Obama accepted the coup that overthrew Honduran democracy.

 The New York Times reported. For the “small upper class,” Honduran President Manuel Zelaya was becoming a threat to what they call “democracy,” namely, the rule of “the most powerful business and political forces in the country.”

Zelaya was initiating such dangerous measures as a rise in the minimum wage in a country where 60 percent live in poverty. He had to go.

Virtually alone, the United States recognized the November elections (with Pepe Lobo the victor) held under military rule — “a great celebration of democracy,” according to Hugo Llorens, Obama’s ambassador.

The endorsement also preserved the use of Honduras’ Palmerola air base, increasingly valuable as the U. S. military is being driven out of most of Latin America.",1,around 100 migrant caravan members have been

This government was authoritarian and regressive, being very opposed to modern trends of the time and aimed to restore France to traditional Catholicism. The Vichy government was made up of a lot of Nazi sympathizers and collaborators. A number of officials were involved in the deportation of the Jewish population to the death camps although only 4 were tried for war crimes. Of course, this is a very, very brief summary.

No. It relates to a POTENTIAL reduction in longevity. Eating red meat does not inherently reduce your life span.

Obesity DOES cause illnesses. 

Meat does not cause cancer, it increases your Risk factors for cancer.  And most of these risks are identified with processed meat. Like cured Bacon.

Rue McClure passed away at the healthy age of 94. She had battled kidney disease for 8 of those final years, and died after sepsis stemming from a hip replacement back in 2014. Rue was the famous Jackson Elementary lunch lady from 1956-1978, serving up cold sloppy Joes and stale cornbread until she retired. She was a loving housewife to seven husbands, all preceding her in death. She won the Jackson County cow pie toss in her youth, back in in '38, and was known to swoon to the musical numbers on Lawrence Welk. She is survived by 22 children, four hundred and fifty seven grandchildren, and 10^5 + e great-grandchildren, one of which became a contestant on the Price is Right back in 2002.

&gt; If China increases its tariffs yet again, we will meet that action by pursuing additional tariffs on another $200 billion of goods.

&gt; These ads, along with the political parties that produce them, are completely banned in Cher&amp;aacute;n, and have been since 2011, when residents overthrew their local government and started over.

It stands to reason there is something better than Capitalism that could come next. Assuming it's the end of progress is naive.

If you need such an hysterical analogy to get your point across, then you clearly do not have enough of an argument to justify your outrageous claims.

The only analogy I am seeing is the IC using 911 as pretext for the invasion of Iraq is the same as the IC using the hacked DNC server as pretext for starting WW3.

&gt; The U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products in early July, and the review period on another $16 billion of imports ends Wednesday.

&gt; The public comment period on the U.S. tariffs aimed at $200 billion ends Aug. 30 after public hearings Aug. 20-23, according to the U.S. Trade Representative&amp;#039;s office.

&gt; The next wave of U.S. tariffs is set to kick in as soon as Wednesday, with the possible imposition of duties on another $16 billion of Chinese imports.

"That's not what I'm saying, I'm not holding some drugs to a different standard. I am simply saying that it's not a ""victimless crime"" in many cases and I'd make the same case for someone that commits a crime while drunk. Drinking isn't a victimless crime as alcohol is not illegal; however, even drinking when it is illegal i.e underage, even then it's not victimless as in many cases the underage drinkers will cause an accident of some sort which can result in injury or death.

All in all, I'm for legalizing all drugs and taxing them like alcohol, as well as having better rehabilitation facilities.

&gt; An alleged neo-Nazi was acquitted by a German court Tuesday for a bombing 18 years ago targeting Jewish immigrants, in what angry victims&amp;#039; advocates called a historic &amp;quot;Legal mistake&amp;quot;.

&gt; Duesseldorf police had questioned Spies and placed him under surveillance soon after the bombing before determining they did not have enough evidence to arrest him.

&gt; A breakthrough in the Duesseldorf case came in June 2014 when a prison inmate told police that Spies - who was briefly in jail over an unrelated offence - had &amp;quot;Bragged&amp;quot; about masterminding the attack, using an anti-immigrant racial slur.

&gt; There will be a 12-month transition period to allow time for discussion with friends and family about organ donation preferences.

&gt; While the new system shifts the balance of presumption in favour of organ donation, those who do not wish to donate their organs will still be able to record their decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register, either via NHS Blood and Transplant&amp;#039;s website or by calling their helpline.

Trade school offered skilled ""hard working"" jobs like welding that required a slip of paper to show you were competent.

&gt; France plans to introduce a penalty system next year that would increase the costs of consumer goods with packaging made of non-recycled plastic, part of a pledge to use only recycled plastic nationwide by 2025, an environment ministry official said Sunday.

&gt; Under the new plan, products with recycled plastic packaging could cost up to 10 percent less, Poirson said.

&gt; &amp;quot;For bottles, giving consumers a choice is possible. But we can&amp;#039;t forget other items - today there&amp;#039;s no recycled plastic available for yogurt pots,&amp;quot; he said.

We will see a return to the mean next quarter, probably slightly above 3%, assuming nothing changes. If all proposed tariffs go into effect, and no resolution is found in the next 6 months, expect annual GDP to be below 3%. If MORE tariffs are imposed, and more are proposed, expect as low as 2%, possibly heading towards a recession.

2) It signals to me that it is not a place where kids will be welcome by patrons of staff, which is fine.

The problem is when channels such as CNN hide behind the facade of ""free press"", when in reality theyre just as partisan as fox.

&gt; Blackwater Guard&amp;#039;s 2nd Murder Trial Ends Without A Verdict Nicholas Slatten was previously found guilty in the 2007 mass shooting of unarmed civilians in Baghdad, but that conviction was overturned last year.

&gt; The second murder trial of Nicholas Slatten, the former Blackwater contractor accused of firing the first shots in a shooting that killed more than a dozen unarmed civilians, has ended in a mistrial.

&gt; The resentencing of the other three Blackwater guards had been postponed until after Slatten&amp;#039;s case was resolved.

&gt; China is to slap tariffs on an additional $60bn of imports from the US in retaliation against $200bn of new trade sanctions on Chinese goods announced by Donald Trump.

&gt; &amp;quot;The US president added:&amp;quot;What China does not understand is that these people are great patriots and fully understand that China has been taking advantage of the United States on trade for many years.

&gt; China faces difficulty in responding on a scale equal to Trump&amp;#039;s new tariffs because its annual imports from the US total only about $130bn, while its exports to the US total more than $500bn.

&gt; A senior Hamas official on Sunday accused Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas of fomenting violence in the region and pushing Israel toward a new war in the Gaza Strip.

&gt; Kahlil al-Hayya, a senior member of the Hamas political bureau, told Gaza newspaper Felesteen that the ruling terrorist group would respond with a &amp;quot;Free hand&amp;quot; against any additional measures imposed by the rival Ramallah government headed by Abbas.

&gt; Abbas has slashed funding to Gaza and cut salaries of PA employees there to pressure Hamas into handing over the territory, making it increasingly difficult for Hamas to govern.

&gt; Beirut - A formerly US-backed Syrian rebel group on Saturday rejected a deal between Russia and Turkey to avert a large-scale military assault on rebel-held Idlib province.

&gt; The deal makes way for a demilitarised zone between rebel and regime-held areas in and around the northwestern governorate, Syria&amp;#039;s last insurgent bastion.

&gt; Pro-Turkey rebels have cautiously accepted the deal, but the Jaysh al-Izza faction on Saturday rejected it, saying the zone to be set up by October 15 would only encompass territory currently under rebel control.

You can read about it here: [Swedish police banned from describing criminals anymore]( When left to assume the race, the public at large seems to assume it is an immigrant instead of someone Swedish born in Sweden in that example.

If we want to turn the tide against this, we need to make immigration reform a top priority. People in the US and EU generally support legal immigration that will benefit their communities. They become afraid when dozens of military age men are housed together and left idle without schooling, work, or similar.",5,crime soars on britains railways with sexual

&gt; STRASBOURG, France - France will start putting up fencing along part of its border with Belgium this weekend to prevent wild boars spreading African swine fever, a virulent livestock disease that could disrupt Europe&amp;#039;s large pig industry.

&gt; France has been on alert for African swine fever since Belgium detected the virus last month among wild boars a few kilometers from the French border.

&gt; The fencing would cover part of the border and be supported by repellent products on roads and other locations that could not be fenced off, Patrick Massenet, head of the hunting federation of Meurthe-et-Moselle, said.

&gt; A Saudi airstrike has claimed the lives of at least 20 Yemeni civilians and 10 others sustained injuries in province of Hudaydah as the regime in Riyadh continues its atrocious campaign against its crisis-hit southern neighbor.

&gt; According to Yemen&amp;#039;s al-Masirah television network, the casualties were caused after Saudi warplanes targeted a group of farmers in a vegetables market in Masoudi area of Bayt al-Faqih district of the western province on Wednesday.

&gt; On October 13, the Saudi planes targeted two buses that were carrying civilians fleeing the port city of Hudaydah, killing at least 17 civilians and wounding 20 others.

"&gt; call not for peace but the destruction of Israel.

Destruction of Israel is propoganda talking point where you can make it as vague as possible. If a country isn't ethnostate then it is ""destroyed"".

Imagine Trump saying the countries being destroyed because there aren't enough white people. 

Destruction implies some violent genocide. When peaceful support for a secular multiethnic state like the one some Palestinians  including Palestinian Christians and Leftists and some Jews support is called as ""destruction"" by the right wing.

For example was the Soviet Union destroyed violently? Reagan wanted to destroy Soviet Union and he destroyed them. 

Does this mean a genocide took place?",-2,israel ambassador to us says radical left college

At the top of a simple google search of traditional Chinese medicine, you will see a link to the NIH website discussing traditional Chinese medicine. The very first sentence is ""Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) originated in ancient China and has evolved over thousands of years.""

The overall gist of it can be summarized with this sentence, ""For most conditions, there is not enough rigorous scientific evidence to know whether TCM methods work for the conditions for which they are used."" TCM covers a broad spectrum, and not much research is done to actually determine whether things are true or not. Even if a few are disproved, there's more than a thousand different treatments we can call TCM.
